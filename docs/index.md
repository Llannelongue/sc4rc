<p>Computing is vital across research disciplines but carries significant environmental costs throughout its lifecycle â€” from hardware production to energy use and disposal. With growing demand for more powerful tools and larger datasets, these impacts are expected to rise. Research communities share responsibility for reducing these effects, requiring coordinated, interdisciplinary action.</p>

<p>The conference will foster knowledge exchange on sustainable computing, focusing on:</p>
- responsible use of computing hardware (sustainable procurement, extending and optimising use phase, responsible disposal)
- resource-efficient software
- carbon-aware scheduling
- FAIR and effective data sharing, storage and curation
- addressing the rebound effect
- community building and training
- field-agnostic and field-specific best practices
- changing user behaviour and incentivising sustainable computing practices (e.g. addressing external drivers)
