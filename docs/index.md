<p>Computing plays a vital role in many areas of research supporting modelling, simulation and data analysis across disciplines ranging from literature and economics, to medicine and astrophysics. Its use has a significant negative impact on the environment, from raw material extraction and processing in production of computing hardware, through energy use in its operation, to its decommissioning and reuse/recycling.  The demand for higher capacity and efficacy of hardware and software tools, as well as increasing dataset size, suggests these environmental impacts will continue to grow, unless synergies between sustainable research practices, resource optimisation and impact mitigation are recognised and exploited.</p>

<p>All research communities have a responsibility to limit the environmental impacts of their activities, and there is a pressing need for a coordinated and interdisciplinary focus on computing impacts. This conference aims to facilitate knowledge exchange between data-intensive disciplines, allowing the sharing of best practice, the development of common resources, and the catalysis of new interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>

<p>Topics covered in this conference will include:</p>
- Estimation and monitoring of environmental impacts and energy usage of computing,
- responsible use of computing hardware (sustainable procurement, extending and optimising use phase, responsible disposal),
- resource-efficient software,
- carbon-aware scheduling,
- FAIR and effective data sharing, storage and curation,
- addressing the rebound effect,
- community building and training,
- general and field-specific best practices, and
- changing user behaviour and incentivising sustainable computing practices (addressing e.g. external drivers).
